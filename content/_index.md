title: Welcome to James & Evie's Website
---

We created this website in 2019 to help communicate our wedding details, and share photos. We're still happily married, but this website isn't needed for our wedding anymore!

If you are trying to get in contact with us both, please go to the [contact page](/contact).

James has his own homepage, at [jread.com](https://jread.com). Evie doesn't have her own homepage because she's less of a nerd!

There isn't much else on this site anymore, maybe you'd be interested in our other travels, [involving dinosaurs](https://dino-adventures.com)?
