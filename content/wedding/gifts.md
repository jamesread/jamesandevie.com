The biggest gift that you can give is the celebration of our marriage,
however, should you wish to give a wedding gift a contribution towards
our dream honeymoon would be greatly appreciated.

We\'re a modern couple, who have been living together for quite some
time! We\'re already sorted for plates, sandwich toasters and all those
traditional wedding gifts! That is why we suggested money if you\'re
looking for an easy option or you\'re just not sure what to get!

If you\'d like to make a contribution online, we have a groovy PayPal
link\...\

\
\...but cards on the day are also more than welcome too, whatever works
for you!
