## General details

Our wedding venue is [Rivervale Barn in Yateley](rivervaleBarn.php). The
post code of the venue is **GU46 7SS** to find it easily on a map. You
need to arrive for 12:30, so please bare this in mind with check-in
times for hotels! You can leave your car at the venue on the night of
the wedding, but it needs to be picked up by 10:00 the next day.

## Aviator Hotel, Farnborough

The Aviator Hotel in Farnborough is rather nice, and about a 10 minute
taxi drive from our wedding venue. Rooms are approximately Â£120 per
night with breakfast. James and Evie will be staying in Rivervale
Cottage on the night of the wedding, but would love to meet up with
friends and family for lunch on Sunday 22nd before we wisk away to our
honneymoon!

Some of the wedding party will be staying here the night before the
wedding (Friday 20th). We have decided not to do a group booking.
