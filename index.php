<h2>Welcome to James &amp; Evie's website</h2>
<p>We created this website in 2019 to help communicate our wedding details, and share photos. We're still happily married, but this website isn't needed
for our wedding anymore!
<p>

<a href = "/photos" class = "photoLink">
<img src = "resources/images/justmarried.jpg" />
</a>

<p>
If you are trying to get in contact with us both, please go to the <a href = "/contact">contact</a> page.
</p>

<p>
James has his own homepage, at <a href = "https://jread.com">jread.com</a>. Evie doesn't have her own homepage because she's less of a nerd!
</p>

</a>

<p>
There isn't much else on this site anymore, 
maybe you'd be interested in our other travels, <a href = "http://dino-adventures.com">involving dinosaurs</a>?
